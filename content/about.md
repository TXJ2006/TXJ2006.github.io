### Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **mathematical theory** and **machine learning**, with a focus on:

- **Learning Theory** — Generalization bounds, learnability of unsupervised algorithms
- **Optimization** — Convex and non-convex optimization, game-theoretic approaches
- **Stochastic Processes** — Rough volatility, Koopman operator theory, dynamical systems
- **Causal Inference** — Geometric disentanglement, non-Gaussian methods

I am passionate about reconstructing machine learning from rigorous mathematical perspectives and exploring next-generation learning paradigms.
