# 🤝 Open for Collaboration

*I believe the best research happens through exchange. If our interests align, let's talk.*

</div>

## Who I Am

I am **Xujiang Tang (唐旭江)**, an undergraduate in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Yangtze University. My work bridges **rigorous mathematical theory** and **modern machine learning**. I have 2 published EI-indexed papers and 5 manuscripts under review at top venues (ICML, ICLR, UAI, COLT, AIMS Mathematics).

I am currently writing an open-access treatise: [*The Mathematical Phenomenology of Machine Intelligence*](/book/) — a 200-chapter work reconstructing ML from first mathematical principles.

## Open Collaboration Directions

<div class="collab-card">

### 📐 Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
<span class="status-open">● OPEN</span>

**Topics:** Learning theory, generalization bounds, optimization geometry, spectral methods, information-theoretic analysis of neural architectures.

**What I bring:** Strong mathematical formalism, proof-writing ability, and a systematic framework connecting algebra, geometry, and analysis to ML phenomena.

**What I'm looking for:** Collaborators with deep knowledge in functional analysis, probability theory, or differential geometry who are interested in ML applications.

</div>

<div class="collab-card">

### 🧠 Causal Inference and Geometric Disentanglement
<span class="status-open">● OPEN</span>

**Topics:** Non-Gaussian causal discovery, geometric approaches to disentangled representations, identifiability theory.

**What I bring:** Background in mathematical modeling, optimization theory (ranked 1st in major, 97/100), and a fresh perspective from pure mathematics.

**What I'm looking for:** Researchers working on causality, representation learning, or statistical independence testing.

</div>

<div class="collab-card">

### 📊 Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Processes in ML
<span class="status-open">● OPEN</span>

**Topics:** Rough volatility models, Koopman operator theory, neural ODEs/SDEs, diffusion models from an SDE perspective.

**What I bring:** Training in differential equations, stochastic calculus fundamentals, and a rigorous approach to continuous-time modeling.

**What I'm looking for:** Applied mathematicians or ML researchers working on dynamics-based models.

</div>

<div class="collab-card">

### ✍️ Co-Authoring Book Chapters
<span class="status-planned">● SEEKING CONTRIBUTORS</span>

**The project:** *The Mathematical Phenomenology of Machine Intelligence* is a 200-chapter open treatise spanning 6 volumes. Writing is ongoing, and I welcome co-authors for chapters in areas outside my core expertise.

**Available volumes for collaboration:**
- Volume III–IV: Generative models, reinforcement learning, game theory
- Volume V: Scaling laws, emergent abilities, interpretability
- Volume VI: Philosophical foundations, consciousness, AI safety

**Format:** Each chapter follows a unified style — Newton's *Principia*-inspired, English, objective academic tone, full proofs, ML interpretations in every section.

</div>

<div class="collab-card">

### 💻 Open-Source Tools and Engineering
<span class="status-planned">● PLANNED</span>

**Ideas:**
- Spectral diagnostic library for neural network training (spectral entropy, Jacobian SVD monitoring)
- Interactive visualizations of the book's mathematical content (e.g., eigenvalue dynamics, gradient flow on manifolds)
- LaTeX → interactive web conversion pipeline

**What I'm looking for:** Developers interested in scientific computing, visualization, or ML tooling.

</div>

## Collaboration Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Co-authored paper** | Joint research leading to a publication at a top venue |
| **Book chapter co-author** | Write one or more chapters of the treatise together |
| **Research discussion** | Regular exchange of ideas, mutual feedback on drafts |
| **Code collaboration** | Joint development of open-source tools or experiments |
| **Mentorship (either direction)** | I'm eager to learn from senior researchers and happy to share what I know |
