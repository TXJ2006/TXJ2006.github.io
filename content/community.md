# 💬 Community

*Mathematics and machine learning are better understood together. Welcome to the conversation.*

</div>

## Why a Community?

This project — the blog, the book, the research — is not meant to be a monologue. Mathematics thrives on dialogue: conjectures need challengers, proofs need readers, and ideas need diverse perspectives to grow.

Whether you are a fellow student, a researcher, an engineer, or simply curious about the mathematical structure of intelligence, you are welcome here.

## How to Participate

<div class="community-card">

### 💬 Comment on Any Page

Every blog post, book chapter, and page on this site has a **comment section** at the bottom (powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app) via GitHub Discussions). You can:

- Ask questions about the mathematical content
- Point out errors or suggest improvements
- Share alternative proofs or perspectives
- Discuss ML applications of the theory

**All you need is a GitHub account.**

</div>

<div class="community-card">

### 🗣️ GitHub Discussions

For broader conversations that don't belong to a specific page, visit the **GitHub Discussions** forum:

🔗 **[github.com/TXJ2006/TXJ2006.github.io/discussions](https://github.com/TXJ2006/TXJ2006.github.io/discussions)**

Suggested categories:
- **Q&A** — Ask mathematical or technical questions
- **Ideas** — Propose new topics, chapter suggestions, or research directions
- **Show & Tell** — Share your own related work or implementations
- **General** — Introductions, meta-discussions, and anything else

</div>

### 🐛 Report Issues

Found a typo? A broken formula? An incorrect proof step? Please report it:

🔗 **[github.com/TXJ2006/TXJ2006.github.io/issues](https://github.com/TXJ2006/TXJ2006.github.io/issues)**

When reporting, please include:
1. Which page/chapter the issue is on
2. The specific section or equation
3. What you think is wrong and (optionally) a suggested fix

</div>

### ✍️ Contribute Content

Interested in contributing a chapter, a blog post, or a correction? See the [Collaboration page](/collaborate/) for details, or open a Pull Request directly:

🔗 **[github.com/TXJ2006/TXJ2006.github.io](https://github.com/TXJ2006/TXJ2006.github.io)**

Contributions of all sizes are valued — from fixing a single typo to co-authoring an entire chapter.

</div>

## Community Guidelines

This is an academic community. Please observe the following principles:

1. **Be respectful.** Disagree with ideas, not people. Constructive criticism is always welcome.
2. **Be precise.** When discussing mathematics, try to be as clear and rigorous as possible.
3. **Be generous.** Share references, alternative explanations, and context freely.
4. **Give credit.** Acknowledge others' contributions and cite sources.
5. **Stay on topic.** Discussions should relate to mathematics, machine learning, or the content on this site.
